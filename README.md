# DailyHuntAssistMode

This is a continuation of the open source DailyHuntAssistMode plugin for FFXIVMINION, originally by anahronik and updated by Gafgarion on the [official forums](https://www.mmominion.com/showthread.php?tid=21734).

I have updated the plugin to work with the new mobs introduced in Dawntrail, though it has not been thoroughly tested. For now, the only locale supported is English, other client languages will not work at this point.

## Installation

To install this plugin, go to your MINIONAPP/Bots/FFXIVMinion64/LuaMods folder and create a folder called "DailyHuntAssistMode". Extract all repository files into that folder; the bot should detect them and provide a new main task called XDaily Hunt Assistant.

## Usage

Select the Setup mode and run the bot. You can then open your hunt bills and go through each mark to add it to the list. Once you have selected the mobs you want to kill, stop the bot and select the Run mode, then start it again.

## Issues

As Dawntrail has just come out, there are bound to be issues. Aside from the lack of thorough testing, navigation meshes in FFXIVMinion are currently only partly finished. Expect weird pathing to hunts for now, there's nothing I can do about this until the meshes are finished.
